For this task we were asked to do the following to pre-written code: Double check the elements in HTML and make sure they follow a logical structure. Check the icon and image elements and give them accessible alt attributes. Make sure the headings were in sequential order. Make sure the title element is concise and descriptive. Fix the navigation list to make sure it was working properly. Go through the code and make sure that it was cleaned up and easier to read.
